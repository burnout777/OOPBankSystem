# OOPBankSystem
Showcase of Object Orientated Programming knowledge using java to make a bank loan system

To create this project many oop principles were taken advantage of including but not limited to:
- Inheritance
- Overriding
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Composition

These are implimented in multiple ways e.g. an interface for the main class and an overall loan class which is overriden by the individual loan types.
Only java utilities were imported, so this should run anywhere.
